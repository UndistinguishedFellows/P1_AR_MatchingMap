Matching image steps

1.Setting the path, you have a default path at “Images/”, but you can change it at will.
2.Image where you want to search for.
3.Image that you want to find in the original photo.
4.Detection threshold, this is a number used to define the precision of the search.
5.Scale factor, for optimization reasons there could be a rescale, but you have the risk to make a false positive.
